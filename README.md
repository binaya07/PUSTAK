## PUSTAK

The project, “Pustak - An Online Bookstore” is an android application which allows
user to buy and sell the second hand books, search for new books in the bookstore and
manage the bookstore (if user has bookstore). Moreover, user can also find the
bookstore where the desired book is available with the location (map) of the
bookstore. If the desired book is available at more than one bookstore then the
bookstore will be arranged in such a manner that the nearest bookstore will appear at
first and will be arranged in ascending order in terms of distance from the user’s
current location. For this, our application will first ask for the accessibility with the
GPS of the mobile. Furthermore, there will be a filter button which allows user to
choose from either old books or new books. The user can also search the books by
specified category like price and genre. The person who wants to sell the second hand
book by our application takes the photo of the book, upload to our application along
with the description like price of the book, contact number, condition of the book,
genre and the person who wants to buy that book will deal with that person and buys
the book. Also, all the data is stored in cloud so the users can manage their account
from anywhere. This application would save the user’s time from visiting different
bookstores and allows user to buy the used books at cheaper price.
